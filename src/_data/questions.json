        "question": "How do I know I am a first-generation student?",
        "answer": "UCSD defines first-generation students as those with with neither parent having a four-year college degree. However, this definition doesn't tell the full story; you can also be first-gen in the international sense or even other senses! \"First-Generation\" can be a complex identity, and generally speaking, if you are doing or pursuing something that noone of your family has done before, then that makes you first-generation."
