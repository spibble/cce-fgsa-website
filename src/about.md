The First-Generation Student Alliance (FGSA) aims to foster a supportive first-generation community at UC San Diego. The primary goal of FGSA is to provide a welcoming and inclusive space where first-generation identifying students can connect, share experiences, and find resources to navigate their academic, professional, and personal journey successfully. FGSA seeks to empower students to embrace their first-generation identity by offering a network of support that addresses their unique challenges and needs. The organization will focus on building the first-generation identity at UC San Diego by creating alliances within the campus community.
