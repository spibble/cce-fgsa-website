The First-Generation Student Alliance (FGSA) at UC San Diego is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering a supportive, inclusive, and empowering community for students who are the first in their families to pursue a college degree. We recognize the unique challenges that first-generation students often face—from navigating unfamiliar academic systems to balancing cultural, familial, and educational expectations—and we aim to provide a space where students can connect, share their experiences, and find resources tailored to their needs.

At FGSA, we believe that being a first-generation college student is not just an identity but a source of strength and pride. We strive to celebrate this identity while helping students overcome the barriers they may encounter in their academic, professional, and personal journeys. Through community-building, mentorship, advocacy, and leadership opportunities, FGSA seeks to uplift first-generation voices and ensure that every student feels seen, supported, and empowered to thrive at UC San Diego.

## Mission
Our mission is to empower first-generation college students at UC San Diego by creating a welcoming community that fosters connection, belonging, and pride in the first-generation identity. We aim to provide the tools, resources, and networks necessary for students to succeed academically, develop professionally, and grow personally.

Through meaningful programs, collaborative partnerships, and advocacy, we work to address the unique needs and challenges faced by first-generation students. We are committed to raising awareness of the first-generation experience across campus, building alliances with other organizations and departments, and promoting a culture of inclusion and equity that benefits the entire university community.

FGSA strives to equip students not only to navigate college but also to lead, inspire, and create lasting change—both within the university and beyond.
