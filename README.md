# cce-fgsa-website
A website for the First Generation Student Alliance club at UCSD made for the second Core Assignment of CCE 3.

## Technologies
- *Eleventy (11ty)*: Static site generator
- *Nunjucks*: Templating language
- Probably not much more than that (if anything), because that would be silly overkill

## Running
- `npm run start`: Build and serve the website on a port
- `npm run clean`: Removes the `dist` directory generated by 11ty
