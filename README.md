# cce-fgsa-website
A website for the First Generation Student Alliance club at UCSD made for the second Core Assignment of CCE 3.

## 
This project is currently being hosted on https://fgsa-ucsd.netlify.app, so feel free to pay it a visit if you wanna see how it's looking so far!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/df62fd8d-1039-4669-b6cf-d3344d43da5d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/fgsa-at-ucsd/deploys)

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Eleventy (11ty)**: Static site generator.
- **Nunjucks**: Templating language.
- Probably not much more than that (if anything), because that would be silly overkill.

(Yeah ik even 11ty and Nunjucks is overkill for a simple static website like this, but I wanted to learn some new stuff)

## 📋 Local Commands
- `npm run build`: Builds the site under the `dist` directory.
- `npm run debug`: Builds the site and also spits out all of the yummy 11ty debug stuff.
- `npm run start`: Builds and serves the website on a port (typically 8080).
- `npm run clean`: Removes the `dist` directory generated by 11ty (if you just want it gone for some reason like I do).
